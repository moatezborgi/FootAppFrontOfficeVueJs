      "content": "The Barcelona managerial situation has been the subject of speculation ever since Xavi Hernandez announced that he would be stepping down as head coach at the end of the season. Club bosses wonât rush into making a decision, although there has been plenty of noise over the last two weeks.  Barca Atletic coach Rafael Marquez and Bolognaâs Thiago Motta have both been linked with the position, although as Fabrizio Romano has told Caught Offside in his exclusive column, neither are in line to be a serious candidate. The same can be said for Antonio Conte, who reportedly offered himself to Barcelona in recent days. âIâm told itâs not true that Antonio Conte has been offered to the club as a candidate to be their next manager. At the moment there is nothing ongoing between Conte and Barca, itâs all quiet. The same is true with Thiago Motta â he is not in the frame for the job at the moment, heâs going to stay in Italy and work in Italy next season. Itâs also completely quiet with Rafael Marquez.â Romano also addressed the ongoing speculation surrounding Hansi Flick, who has emerged as a leading contender for the Barcelona job. âWith Hansi Flick, Iâm told he would be super happy to come to Barca, heâs super open to this possibility. But itâs on Barca â Laporta and Deco have to decide who is the manager they want, and at the moment they have not made a decision, it will still be some time before we know the new Barca coach.â There are sure to be plenty of twists and turns on the Barcelona managerial situation over the coming months. One thing for certain is that Xavi is not considering staying on in the role, despite an upturn in form over the last couple of weeks.",

      "publish_time": "8 hours ago",
      "content": "Manchester United legend Gary Neville has called his former club 'naÃ¯ve' after years of operating without a sporting director.  Mail Sport exclusively revealed on Wednesday that the Red Devils are on the cusp of reaching an agreement with Newcastle over sporting director Dan Ashworth, who is keen on swapping St James' Park for Old Trafford. The 52-year-old is seen as the best in the business by incoming Man United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his INEOS team, and the focus of his remit would be recruitment. Ashworth has not had as much control as he expected at Newcastle, the club he joined in the summer of 2022. There has been no fallout but it is thought the lure of the project at Man United, and his relationship with INEOS director of sport Sir Dave Brailsford, has persuaded him the time is right to move on.  Discussing Ashworth's imminent move to Old Trafford on the Stick to Football podcast by Sky Bet, Neville urged that Manchester United have been 'naÃ¯ve' and lost out on millions during negotiations without a sporting director. 'Agents have a bad reputation in football, but ultimately, they won't do someone over that they work well with, because they won't get the next gig. If an agent screwed over Liverpool, that agent wouldn't work with Liverpool again and it would spread quite quickly,' Neville said. 'Manchester United haven't had a sporting director for the last 10 years, so they've been so naÃ¯ve at that level. I imagine when they've been dealing with agents, if United called you, you knew you were going to get another Â£20-30million because they were naÃ¯ve and didn't have a relationship with agents.' Recruitment is Ratcliffe's number one priority at Manchester United, with the rebuild of Old Trafford secondary. INEOS are determined to find a better balance to recruitment than what has been achieved over the past 10 years and have identified Ashworth as the ideal lead to a new-look team. After impressing at West Bromwich Albion, Ashworth became the FA's Director of Elite Development in 2012 and pioneered 'England DNA', a player development plan for both the men's and women's teams. Despite attracting interest from United, Ashworth moved to Brighton as technical director in 2019 before taking on his new role at St James' Park in August 2024ruary 2022. Neville continued: 'Dan Ashworth did a good job at West Brom, but I was there with England when he was appointed, and it was a big change when he came in. It was quite a jolt at the time for Roy Hodgson to have a technical director like Dan Ashworth, who then brought in Dave Reddin who was a performance director.   'This was then they started talking about different types of coaches (e.g. attacking and defending coaches), and they were talking about attacking set piece coaches, breaking the game down to intimate detail, which was something Roy wasn't used to. 'I remember Dan having a conversation with Roy, but they were building all these foundations, where he started with the U21s, the U18s and with the women's team. You think of the success of all those teams in recent years, but that has been in the making for eight years, and it all started when Dan came in. 'Iâm not saying heâs responsible for what happened, but he had a big influence with FA. They were a terrible organisation from a professionalism point of view, and I felt what he did, he put processes in place where theyâre now structured and organised.'",

      "content": "In another thrilling weekend of Premier League action, the agony and ecstasy of the world's premier football competition was on full display.  Excitement has thus far being the name of the game and the 2023-24 season is on course to set a new record for total goals in Premier League history. Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool all picked up wins to strengthen their title ambitions, with all three showing no signs of slowing down their charge towards the top spot as we approach the final third of the campaign. Meanwhile, the battle of the chasing pack continues with Manchester United securing what could prove to be a crucial three points in the race for Champions League football as they left it late to defeat Aston Villa. Elsewhere in the table the competition for points is just as fierce, with Sheffield United defeating Luton to keep a glimmer of hope alive that they can make the most unlikely of pushes for Premier League safety. To gain a deeper insight into the emotions involved in top flight football Mail Sport have enlisted forensic lip-reader Jeremy Freeman to offer his analysis on what was said in some of the weekend's most animated incidents. After narrowly escaping relegation last season, Nottingham Forest once again find themselves dicing with death at the wrong end of the table. Steve Cooper's sacking in December was followed by back-to-back wins for Nuno Espirito Santo, but that new manager bounce could yet be negated by a possible points penalty for breaking the league's financial rules. The Tricky Trees are now slipping back into their old ways on the pitch and found themselves winless in three ahead of Newcastle's visit to the City Ground. Bruno Guimaraes gave the visitors the perfect start, but Forest fought back twice to head into the interval level. In the second-half Taiwo Awoniyi was brought down by Martin Dubravka, with former referee Mark Clattenburg telling Mail Sport it was 'impossible' for the striker to stay on his feet.    However referee Anthony Taylor did not point to spot, leading to furious protests on the Forest bench captured on the broadcast that were only exacerbated after the referee cautioned Santo's assistant, Rui Pedro Silva. In his analysis of the clip, Freeman noted the No 2 saying: 'Hey? Hey? [indecipherable] That is nothing. I was sitting on the bench, I was sitting on the bench, man, of course, sitting on the b****y bench.' Things would go from bad to worse for the hosts in short order, with Guimaraes again popping up to fire Newcastle to victory and secure the three points. After victory over Liverpool kept their title ambitions alive, Arsenal travelled to the London Stadium on Sunday intent on reaffirming their status as genuine contenders. Mikel Arteta's side wasted little time getting down to business at the London Stadium. With the game still level in the early stages Alphonse Areola attempted to kickstart a counter for the Hammers by launching a throw towards Edson Alvarez on the left flank. The summer signing's first touch flattered to deceive however, and he was forced into a rash challenge to deny an onrushing Bukayo Saka possession.    With the England international left writhing on the pitch, Alvarez was shown a yellow card, and, according to Freeman was not expecting his caution. 'No, no, nah, no, he didn't hurtâ¦(referee then brandishes yellow)â¦what?' Gabriel then involved himself by squaring up to Alvarez with the pair exchanging heated words. 'F**k off, you dirty c***t,' Freeman believes Gabriel to have told the West Ham defender - with the second expletive matching the lip patterns and the context of the situation. Alvarez retorts: 'F**k off Magalhaes (Gabriel's surname), how can you...' before the camera cuts away. The Brazilian would ultimately have the last laugh, joining Saka on the scoresheet in a 6-0 thumping as they handed the Hammers their joint-heaviest home defeat in Premier League history. For as jubilant an afternoon as Sunday was for the Gunners it was equally as devastating for David Moyes. The Scotsman's second spell in charge at the east London club has been punctuated by moments of triumph followed by sinking despair, and unfortunately for Moyes recent results have fallen squarely in the latter category. Such was the disappointment of the defeat, contract extension talks for the manager have been paused, with the club now winless in their last seven games in all competitions.   Freeman's analysis of the former Everton boss's words captures the frustration of a manager watching his team completely blown out of the water. In the 84th minute, the cameras cut to an exasperated Moyes, who can be seen muttering to himself after Jakub Kiwior is penalised for a foul on Mohammed Kudus: 'For f*** sake, it's about time, how many times, it's not [indecipherable}... count how many fouls'. While West Ham's momentum has ground to a halt in recent weeks, Manchester United have very much been in the ascendency. Erik ten Hag has spent much of the campaign to this point trying to reignite the success of his maiden term in Manchester and with a youthful spine at its core it looks to finally be underway. Against Aston Villa, United faced one of their primary rivals for a Champions League place and proved they can get a result at a critical juncture of the campaign. Rasmus Hojlund continued his fine form in front of goal with a fifth in as many games, before Douglas Luiz equalised for the hosts and likely ruffled a few feathers with an exuberant goal celebration.    How fitting then that the pair would come together in stoppage time after substitute Scott McTominay had fired United back into the lead with a header in the closing minutes of normal time. As Hojlund walked off the pitch after being replaced by Jonny Evans, the young forward enraged the Villa Park faithful by gesturing at them to calm down and reminding them of the score. Luiz then confronted the Dane, with Freeman noting he said: 'You s***, come on, you know, you push off, just go off,' as he attempted to hasten his departure. A more fiery remark was still to come however, with a fan wearing a club-branded hoodie aiming a expletive-laden diatribe at the 21-year-old and appearing to refer to the him as a 'n***e'. 'You f*****, f*** off, you f****** n***e,' he could be seen shouting at the Dane.",

      "content": "The Champions League represents the only realistic chance of Barcelona winning a trophy this season, given that they lost in the Spanish Super Cup final, are out of the Copa del Rey, and are 10 points adrift of Real Madrid in the La Liga title race. Even then, Xavi Hernandezâs side will be considered as outsiders to win their sixth ever European cup, given that they have been poor over the last few months.  Still, they have as good a chance as any of winning the tournament, although they have a very tough task to get past Napoli in their last 16 tie, which kicks off next week with the first leg in Naples. If Barcelona can pick up a positive result in that one, they will have a good chance of reaching the quarter-finals. Barcelona have received some much-needed good news ahead of that second leg at Montjuic, as it has been reported by Relevo that La Liga have pencilled in their match with Mallorca for the 8th of March, which is a Friday. It means that they will have an extra day of rest before the match against Napoli, which takes place on the 12th. Itâs uncommon for Barcelona to play in La Liga on a Friday, itâll only be the second time this season that it has happened (vs Sevilla on MD3). Xavi and his players are sure to be grateful for the extra day to prepare, which they will certainly need.",

Beginning with President Joan Laporta, a number of figures came out to share their grief at his passing.  âAlways by Barcaâs side and active in âBarcelonaismâ from Guardiola de Bergueda, his small and beloved homeland, the Culers will never forget you Joan, the Grandfather of Barca. My condolences to family and friends.â The likes of Marc Bartra, Alexia Putellas and Ansu Fati all posted on social media about Casals folllowing the news. Iconic for his beard and vintage Barcelona shirt, the genesis of his fame comes from an old cartoon. As highlighted by Esport3, Valenti Castanys originally drew a figure (that would come to resemble Casals later), before a statue of âthe grandfather of Barcaâ was erected outside of the original La Masia building. Casals began going to games regularly in the eighties, and quickly became a cult hero amongst Blaugrana fans.",

      "publish_time": "13 August 2024",
      "content": "From luxury holidays and VIP experiences galore to almost unlimited spending power - the life of a WAG might seem like the stuff of dreams. Yet it's not all it's cracked up to be...  That's at least according to the partner's of three top footballers, who have described some of the difficulties that comes with the role - from the stress of matches and the 'emotional rollercoaster' of moving abroad to having to let their own careers take a back seat. Taylor Ward, the husband of Riyad Mahrez, is one of the stars of Married To The Game, a show that focuses on the lives of footballer's wives and will stream on Prime Video from August 2024ruary. She appears on the series alongside fellow WAGs Cat Harding, fiancee of Arsenal star Jorginho and Sara Gundogan, wife of Manchester City's midfielder Ilkay Gundogan. In advance of the documentary, all three spoke to MailOnline to offer an exclusive insight into their lives - from the highs to the lows. Here is what they revealed - Taylor Ward defended her husband Riyad Mahrez after he faced backlash for telling his sobbing wife 'it's part of the game, innit' while revealing a move to Saudi Arabia. Ward, 25, said people have 'misunderstood' the French-Algerian footballer's tone as he told her about the move from Cheshire to Jeddah in an emotional clip that went viral. Setting the record straight, she admitted his response to her being upset was blunt - but said that was down to French people being more 'to the point'. The footballer, who captains the Algerian national team, had been playing for Man City but telephoned her to say he had signed a four year contract with Al-Ahli in the Saudi Arabian pro league. Weeping as she recalls the moment in Married To The Game, she tells the Mail: 'Riyad rang me and basically told me we are moving to Saudi. I'm going to be sat at home on my own.'   Ward has now said: 'I was shocked that people picked up on that so much. 'It's funny because obviously from watching the trailer he has such a blunt response to me being upset but I think that's our relationship. 'He is very blunt - a bit tough love. Riyad is French and French people in general are very to the point. Also he is a man. I think he's only cried in front of me twice in our relationship and it was not the Saudi move - so that's just who he is.' She added: 'Riyad is very calm, he doesn't panic under pressure and he's very to the point and straight talking whereas I'm a bit of a flapper in those situations. 'I actually think as harsh as it sounds I think that's why we work because he kind of brings me back down to earth. He's very much like: 'It is what it is you need to get on with it.' 'If I had someone there consoling me patting my back saying 'oh I know life's so sad you are moving to Saudi' I would probably feel worse. 'We are just married and he is so supportive. Obviously as much as he is straightforward and to the point he is the most loving person ever. 'If I was really upset about the Saudi move or if I was really genuinely depressed and upset about it he wouldn't put us in a position where I would feel like that. 'I think he just knew it was kind of me panicking in the moment and having a wobbly and that I would be fine the next day. He knows how to deal with me that's for sure.'    Taylor and daughter Mila have this week flown out to Jeddah to make their move permanent after spending months house-hunting and moving back and forth between Saudi and the UK. She said: 'Originally when I said: 'If we move we will all be moving together' I wasn't thinking that it would be as far as Saudi Arabia. I was thinking maybe down south to London or something like that. 'Riyad had to go over straight away so we moved into a hotel. It took us a few months to find a house which we have found now.' She said their house is 'gorgeous' and that the main problem they had when house hunting was that some of the houses in Saudi Arabia were like 'palaces'. 'Honestly we were walking around them and I was like: ''I don't know what we are going to put in these rooms, we are running out of ideas. We can't live here! This is getting ridiculous. How many rooms there are?'' 'They were genuinely too big. I think we have found something now which is really nice. It's still really spacious but we are not going to be getting lost on different floors trying to find each other.'  Ward said the move came as a 'huge shock' that she didn't see coming. She said she has a close group of friends and family in Manchester - though her parents and two sisters live in Dubai. 'Recently every time I've been in Saudi my mum will turn up as it's only two hours away,' she told. 'My mum is interior designing our house in Saudi so she has been back and forth non stop and she loves it. 'She and Riyad get on like a house on fire from the day they met and I think he actually speaks to my mum and dad (former footballer Ashley Ward) than he does to me. 'Me and Riyad met not long before lockdown and around a week after he first met my parents we went into lockdown and he ended up moving in with me and my family, so from day one they have been inseparable.' 'We always said that if a move comes up and it's best for Riyad and best for our family we will take it and go together. A football career is such a short period of time that you just have to make the most of it whilst it lasts.' As for life when he retires â she says that they are thinking of a move to Dubai. Arsenal WAG Cat Harding avoids her fiancÃ© Jorginho for 24 hours after a defeat and says her life revolves around his schedule. The mother-of-two, 33, told MailOnline she isn't a big fan of football and doesn't know the offside rule â only agreeing to watch the sport when her 32-year-old husband to be is playing. In an exclusive interview, the singer gave an insight into being the spouse of a sportsman, saying there's 'no way' she can talk to Jorginho when he loses a game and they even have to postpone dinner plans because of his low mood. The Italian midfielder, who earns a reported Â£110,000 a week, proposed to Cat in December with a love heart rose display and violinist that was captured on camera for the upcoming TV show. And now the former Voice UK contestant is planning their elaborate wedding set to be held in Italy, excitedly revealing she has already chosen her dream dress.    Cat said: 'I do feel like I am married to the game. 'It changes a lot of thingsâ¦ your whole life revolves around the schedule of your partner but to another level because it's not a normal schedule where you can plan. Everything has to be planned around what's going on with them. 'You can't plan anything in advance unless it is in June. I am planning my wedding for next summer because J could possibly be in the Euros this year again so it will be next year. 'Even certain things like we have often had dinner planned with friends and if they lose a game, we have to cancel and I feel the worst but there's no way you can go out with someoneâ¦ after J has finished a game and they lost, there is no way I can talk to him for 24 hours. He is not in the mood.' Cat, who is a mum to daughter Ada, eight, from her relationship with Hollywood actor Jude Law, 51, and shares son Jax, three, with Jorginho, says she didn't win over her fiancÃ© by pretending to like football. In fact, Cat has only recently learned there are 11 players in a team and admits the rules of the game are still a mystery to her. She said: 'I am not crazy into football and I have never pretended that I am. I don't know anything about it. 'I love going to the games because it is a completely different atmosphere and it is different when you are at the game, you can feel the energy in the stadium, compared to when you are watching it at home.    'I don't watch football other than when he is playing. I don't know any of the rules, I don't know the offside rule, I don't know anythingâ¦ he tries to explain it to me. I honestly just learned there are 11 players.' Shortly after their engagement, the couple, who originally met on a dating app, moved into a new home in London's West Hampstead to be closer to Ada's school and Jorginho's training ground. Despite a hectic start to the year, Cat has already found her wedding dress and is planning to scope out venues in Italy ahead of their big day in the summer of 2025. She said: 'We got engaged on December 6 so right before Christmas. 'We had family over from Brazil afterwards, we had the kids here, we were so busy and then it was Christmas, then we went away and since we got back, we moved house. 'But I did say to J last night I think I'm going to go to Italy next month and start looking at venues. 'I think I have found my wedding dress but it is the second dress I have tried on so I probably need to go to some other shops.'  Jorginho's commitment to the game, which has seen him win UEFA men's player of the year, means he is often apart from his family. The father-of-three, who also has a son and a daughter from his first marriage to Natalia Leteri, explained the biggest sacrifices are the special moments he misses with his children. Speaking on the show, he said: 'Everyone thinks football is happy and you have no problems, but we sacrifice a lot. 'The biggest one is being away all the time and not being close and missing many important moments... the kids growing up... it's not as easy as people think and that's the reality.' Married to the Game viewers will have the chance to watch the Euro 2022 winner's romantic proposal, which Cat says has earned Jorginho bragging rights amongst his teammates. But making a TV moment of the intimate occasion wasn't Jorginho's intention as Cat reveals he's shy off the pitch and as a performer she's more outgoing in their relationship.  She said: 'J didn't want to propose on camera, that's one thing he wanted to hold back on. 'He's actually a lot shyer than me especially when he doesn't know someone. He really takes time to analyse a situation and know what's going on, he's not very forward at first. 'But it felt absolutely amazing. I was expecting it but how he managed to trick me in the moment, it was a whole other thing. He put in so much work and he went above and beyond to make it special. He is quite something. 'He is now giving tips to other players and friends about how to do proposals.' Cat hopes watchers will see there's more to the wives and girlfriends of Premier League players than luxury holidays, beautifying and designer bags, as she labels 'WAG' a 'stupid term.' She said: 'It is still used so much. It doesn't affect me that much, I laugh at it. 'I don't like it or think it's right. We have our own lives and do our own things, other wives and partners of the players are really successful women in their own right so I don't think it should be a term that is used to label them. 'But for me personally, I just let it goâ¦ it doesn't affect my life or how I feel about myself it's just a stupid term.' Sara Gundogan has revealed she misses living in Manchester despite her previous criticism of the city's 'horrible' food. Gundogan, previously Sara Arfaoui, started dating former Man City star Ilkay Gundogan in 2021 before they tied the knot a year later. They have one son together, Kais, who was born in March 2023. Sara was a highly-successful TV presenter and model before meeting Ilkay, with the couple relocating to Barcelona this summer after the midfielder joined the Catalan giants upon the expiry of his contract at the Etihad. He enjoyed a hugely decorated seven-year spell with City, winning 14 trophies, which included captaining Pep Guardiola's side to a historic Treble last season.   However, things were sometimes tricky off the pitch, with Sara infamously criticising Manchester on occasions, which included one rant about the quality of the food in October 2022. She posted on her Instagram story: 'Sorry, I'm sad to be honest but nothing. I tried [sic] so bad to find a good restaurant but horrible food everywhere. 'Can't find a real Italian or good sushi or just fresh foodâ¦ everything frozen. Restaurants here are focus [sic] on making money with drinks and shot [sic] like nightclubs, not quality food. Maybe in London but in Manchester nothing. I'm sorry.' However, speaking exclusively to Mail Sport, Sara revealed that she grew to love Manchester and actually found it hard to leave in the summer. 'When I was in Manchester, my whole life was (originally) around football,' she said. 'My friends were football, the people I met through my husband, and then I didn't have anything that was just my world outside of that. 'And I'm a social person. So it took me a bit of time, but I made it friends and it was really nice. 'After making friends, I was really happy. I had my own life and routine in Manchester and I have one of my best friends there.'    There were several rumours about Ilkay's future in the summer, with the midfielder linked with clubs across the globe, while there was also a chance he would stay at City. And Sara went onto explain the difficulty of leaving Manchester behind after finding out her husband would be moving abroad. She added: 'Over the years I would see friends moving so it's something that's always around in football and you would suddenly just have a phone call from them telling you they're going to another country. 'So, it's always around, it's always happening but I didn't imagine that it would be us and when it's you it's big a shock. 'It's always sad, especially because you make friends, you're happy somewhere, you build your life and then you have to leave all the people you love.' Sara also reflected on her initial struggles in Manchester and explained how sticking with things ultimately paid off. She added : 'I think it's really hard to live in England when you are alone in the house and you can't meet anyone. 'But when you start to know a bit more about it, how to go around and have friends, I think the place changes completely and you can enjoy it. 'I started to enjoy everything and I kind of miss Manchester now.'   Sara went on to list some of the challenges of being a WAG, including letting her own career take a back seat. 'As a wife sometimes you are on the side,' she exclusively told Mail Sport. 'But it was hard because despite my work as a TV presenter, the fact I speak six languages and travelled the world as a model, when I was him, everything I did, suddenly it became zero and I just became his wife. 'The people knew me before as a media star but when I became a wife, there is the tendency of the press to show wives of players in a certain way and it's like we have to fit this cliche. 'I lost a bit my spontaneity, my way of speaking without thinking. So yeah, it's a bit hard, because you have to also rebuild yourself and find your own identity. 'It's kind of sad because there is no other sport, there is nothing similar, say in cinema or politics, that will describe a wife of an important politician that way.' Sara also admitted she was 'shocked' at her husband's move to Barcelona and didn't initially believe the rumours.  'I didn't really believe those (rumours about joining Barcelona),' she said. 'Every summer and January, in every transfer market people would always come to me with rumours. 'Some people even used to text me to say \"you're coming to Italy?\" and I was never taking anything seriously. 'I had friends texting me saying I was coming back, and I was like, \"no\". It just happened. And the funny fact is that I didn't take it seriously. 'I was like, no it cannot be because my husband is many years here in Manchester and I don't see this happening. She continued: 'I was in Italy, it was holiday time. It was my first holiday with my baby and I went to meet all my friends. So I was a bit in my bubble, let's say baby bubble. 'And I just got a phone call and it was like \"we are going there\". I wasn't taking it seriously. I don't know if it was a shock. So it took me a bit of time to realise what was happening.'",
